A contact manager in Python with a Tkinter interface.

## Overview

An old and somewhat outdated project of mine; in fact, py_tk_contact represents one of my initial forays into python programming. It's one of my first "big" projects. It demanded time and dedication. 

In the end, I don't find the code to be so bad. Even though I didn't strictly adhere to PEP 8 rules in this project, I can mark it as a humorous start with the Python language. (I had to present an oral on this project, by the way.)
